          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>According to our data, the percentage of Obese population seem to have a linear correlation with the poverty
            percentage. There seems to be no correlation between age and obesity, however there is an inverse linear corelation
            with Median Household Income, agreeing with the linear correlation with poverty rates.
            One of the probable underlying cause could be the large intake of food rich in satured fat, sodium
            and sugar as the ones found in common fast food chains. However, this would require further investigation.</p>

          <p>As with obesity, the percentage of smokers has a linear correlation with poverty and an inverse correlation with
            Household income. But unlike obesity, the rate of smokers also seem to have a linear correlation with age.
            This age correlation could be cause by a generation gap, but again, this would require further sampling.
          </p>

          <p>Furthermore, there is a clear linear correlation between the rate of poverty and the lack of healtchare,
            and an inverse linear correlation with Household income.
            There is also a very steep correlation between age and lack of healthcare, as age increases
            the lack of healthcare sharply decreases. </p>
